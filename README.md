cpp-in-any-language
===================

I can code C++ in any language.. Javascript this time. 

It is very tempting to just use Javascript as 'that stuff that goes between
the html to do animations', but it is a serious language in its own right. 
If a very strange one.

Javascript is fun to display the output of your C++ code, for example. 

My friend Zwane Mwaikambo noted that, unlike in other languages he has
experience with, he'd never felt comfortable enough in Javascript do write 
something worth storing, worth reusing, and I recognize that feeling.

In these various examples, I'm developing my "javascript"-style, which might help
other C++-heads feel at home, perhaps at home enough to make serious use of 
this quaint but powerful language.
